### Curious Researcher

This is a small project of mine that uses ChatGPT to help research topics. It basically works as follows:

1. Ask any question.
2. Get a response together with 5 generated follow-up questions.
3. Select one of the generated questions or type your own.
4. Repeat step 2 and 3.

Instructions:
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and enter your OpenAI API key. 
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python ./main.py`
